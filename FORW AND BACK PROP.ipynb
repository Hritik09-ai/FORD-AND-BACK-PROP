    "# QUES.1 What is the purpose of forward propagation in a neural network?\n",
    "# ANSWER \n",
    "The purpose of forward propagation in a neural network is to compute the output of the network given certain input data and the current set of parameters (weights and biases). Here’s a detailed explanation of its purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "Compute Outputs: Forward propagation involves passing the input data through the network layer by layer, from the input layer through the hidden layers to the output layer. Each layer performs two main computations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear Transformation: The input data is multiplied by weights and added to biases, resulting in a linear transformation at each neuron.\n",
    "Activation Function Application: After the linear transformation, an activation function (such as sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, etc.) is applied to introduce non-linearity into the network. This allows the network to learn and approximate complex relationships between inputs and outputs.\n",
    "Generate Predictions: As the input data propagates through the layers, the final layer produces an output or prediction based on the learned parameters. For instance, in a classification task, the output might represent probabilities for each class using softmax, or in a regression task, it might directly predict a numerical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loss Calculation: After obtaining the predictions from the network, forward propagation also involves comparing these predictions with the actual target values (in supervised learning tasks). This comparison is done using a loss function (such as mean squared error for regression or cross-entropy loss for classification). The loss function quantifies how well (or poorly) the network is performing on the given task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Calculation (Optional in Forward Propagation): In some contexts, especially when using automatic differentiation libraries, forward propagation may also calculate gradients of the loss with respect to the network parameters. These gradients are later used in the backpropagation step to update the parameters and improve the network’s performance during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the primary purpose of forward propagation is to compute predictions or outputs of the neural network for a given input, evaluate how well the network is performing via a loss function, and prepare for the subsequent backpropagation step where gradients are calculated for optimizing the network parameters.\n"

    "# QUES.5 What is the purpose of applying a softmax function in the output layer during forward propagation?\n",

    "The softmax function is typically applied in the output layer of a neural network during forward propagation for\n",
    "classification tasks. Its primary purpose is to convert the raw scores (often called logits) generated by the\n",
    "last hidden layer into probabilities.\n",
    "Probabilistic Interpretation: The softmax function outputs a vector where each element represents the probability of a corresponding class. This is achieved by exponentiating the input values (logits) and then normalizing them by their sum. \n",
    "\n",
    "Output as Probabilities: By applying softmax, we ensure that the output of the neural network can be interpreted as probabilities. These probabilities sum up to 1 across all classes, making it suitable for tasks where the model needs to choose one class among several mutually exclusive classes (e.g., classification tasks).\n",
    "\n",
    "Loss Calculation: In many commonly used loss functions for classification tasks (such as cross-entropy loss), the softmax function is often part of the equation. The output probabilities from softmax are used to compute the loss between the predicted probabilities and the actual (true) probabilities (one-hot encoded labels).\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient Computation: During backpropagation (backward pass), using softmax ensures that the gradients computed for the parameters (weights and biases) are influenced by the probabilities and their relation to the true labels. This helps in adjusting the parameters to minimize the loss effectively.\n",

    "Here’s a detailed breakdown of its purpose:\n",

    "Weight Update: Using the gradients calculated by backpropagation, the weights of the network are updated in the opposite direction of the gradient. This iterative process continues until the network reaches a point where the error is minimized or converges to a satisfactory level.\n",

    "Training Process: By iteratively adjusting the weights based on the gradients, backpropagation effectively trains the neural network. The network learns to map inputs to outputs by minimizing the difference between predicted and actual outputs (i.e., minimizing the loss function).\n",
